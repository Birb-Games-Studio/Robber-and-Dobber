Source code for the game in case you wanna see what makes this tick, or wanna help out with making of Robber And Dobber.

This project uses [FMOD](https://fmod.com/download), with out it sound will be broken (currently we have only footsteps).

Robber And Dobber was going to be a mix of [Neighbours from Hell](https://store.steampowered.com/app/260750/Neighbours_from_Hell_Compilation/) and [Untitled Goose Game](https://goose.game).
Idea was to be a grebe named Dobber, Dobber lives with an old man named Ron, he is a war veteran and has some interesting tings stuffed around the house.
One day Ron goes out to get his medication but while he is away you notice from the window that someone is trying to open the door, it must be a robber!

You walk around the house searching for items that can be used as traps. and try getting rid of that robber.



Robber has 3 bars.
Health - the lower the health goes the more scarred robber get's.
Fear - how much the robber is scarred of you.
Anger - if he get's angry enough he will go after you and try to rip you apart.


Controls:
Escape - exit game.
W/S - walking forwards and backwards.
A/D - turning left and right.
L.Shift - start flopping your wings when standing still, run when moving.
E - hold to grab a trap and drag it around the map.
F - arm the trap.
